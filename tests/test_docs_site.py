"""
The static docs site under ``site/docs/`` is generated, and stays generated.

``site/`` deploys to any static host with no build step — that is what makes
the marketing site trivial to host — so the rendered HTML is committed rather
than built at deploy time. The cost of committing generated output is drift:
someone edits ``docs/*.md``, the markdown and the published page disagree, and
nothing says so.

These tests are what says so. The first re-runs the generator into a temp
directory and compares it byte-for-byte with what is committed; editing the
vault without running ``python site/build_docs.py`` fails here. The rest pin
the properties the generator exists to provide.
