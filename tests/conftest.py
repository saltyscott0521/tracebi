"""Keep web report builds out of the repo's output/ during tests.

The reports router writes ``output/<name>.html`` beside the working
directory. Tests that drive that router stay in the repo root (they
resolve models and packages from there), so a build would leave a
receipt in the checkout. Tests that ``chdir`` have already chosen a
directory; those still write beside that directory.
