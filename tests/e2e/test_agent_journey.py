"""The agent journey over the MCP gateway, against a scaffolded project:

    get_context → list models → a stamped query → validate a spec (wrong, then
    right) → render it → verify the receipt → build the report package →
    fetch the artifact back

plus the gateway's two security promises: a report name can't climb out of
``reports/``, and fetch can't read outside the output root. The tools are the
same plain functions the MCP server registers.
