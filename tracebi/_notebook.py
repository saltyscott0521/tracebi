"""
Internal helper: read a Jupyter notebook and return its code cells as
a single executable Python source string.

Used by ``tracebi.cli`` (``tracebi run``) and ``tracebi.web.discovery``
(auto-discovery) so that ``.ipynb`` files in ``requests/`` behave the
same as ``.py`` files.

Line magics (``%matplotlib inline``) and shell escapes (``!pip install``)
are silently dropped — they have no meaning outside a Jupyter kernel.
