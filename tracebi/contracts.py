"""
Transform contracts — the receipt extends to phase ①, honestly.

Phase ① is deliberately unconstrained and untraced (the manifesto refusal
stands: no lineage through free-form pandas). What CAN be honest about it
is the **sink**: a transform may declare what must be true of the tables it
just sank — row counts, key uniqueness, referential integrity, value
domains, cross-table reconciliation — checked at sink time as read-only SQL
against the warehouse, and recorded beside it.

The exact language, locked by design review (architecture v2 §2.6):
**"the sink satisfied its contract" — never "the transform was verified."**
A contract says the landed tables met their declared shape; it says nothing
about whether the pandas above them was right.

Usage, at the bottom of a transform, after the sinks::

    from tracebi.contracts import contract

    with contract("holdings", warehouse=WAREHOUSE) as c:
        c.rows("fact_holdings", at_least=10)
        c.unique("dim_issuer", ["issuer_id"])
        c.not_null("fact_holdings", ["issuer_id", "fair_value"])
        c.foreign_key("fact_holdings", "issuer_id",
                      refers_to=("dim_issuer", "issuer_id"))

A contract (and any single check) may also carry a ``note`` — the author's
**stated methodology**: "dropped the 9 unkeyed rows", "excluded par=0
revolvers from the grain". A note is prose recorded verbatim beside the
checks; it is what the transform *states* about itself, never a verified
claim — it earns no badge, never reads green, and never colors any status.
The locked vocabulary extends: "the transform states" — never "verified
methodology".

The vocabulary is CLOSED and declarative — no callables, fully re-runnable
data — for the same reason report specs are: a check that cannot be
serialized cannot be replayed or reviewed. Any failed check **raises** at
the end of the block: a sink that violates its contract must not freeze a
warehouse that claims otherwise. On success the record — every check with
its observed value, plus a fingerprint per touched table — is written to
``<warehouse>.contracts.json`` (``data/warehouse.duckdb`` →
``data/warehouse.contracts.json``): the freeze point carries its own
certificate.

**The fingerprint join, pinned** (v2 §6 flaw 4): the recorded table
fingerprint is NOT computed from any in-memory frame — it is computed by
reading the sunk table back through ``DuckDBConnector.load()``, the same
connector path the model uses at load time, hashed with the one
``frame_fingerprint`` algorithm. Any dtype or ordering normalization the
write-then-read round trip performs is therefore inside BOTH sides of the
later comparison against a report's recorded input fingerprints, so the
join can classify ``satisfied`` / ``stale`` without false drift.
