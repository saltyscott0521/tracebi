"""
Folder-based auto-discovery for request and scheduled scripts.

Two entry points:

* :func:`auto_discover` — register every report in a directory: ``*.json``
  specs and ``<name>/`` packages, in that directory and in any folder below
  it, plus import every top-level ``*.py`` / ``*.ipynb`` file (skips
  ``_*``). A report in a folder is addressed by its path, e.g.
  ``finance/weekly_summary``, so two folders can each hold one of the same
  name. Decorators inside imported modules (``@registry.report``,
  ``@registry.scheduled``) fire as a side effect of import. Notebook code
  cells are concatenated into a script first; line magics and shell escapes
  are silently dropped.

* :func:`reload_modules` — re-import the modules previously discovered
  via :func:`auto_discover`. Used by the optional dev-mode reload endpoint
  to pick up edits without restarting the server.
