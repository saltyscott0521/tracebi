"""
Optional auth for the TraceBi web layer.

Two modes, mutually exclusive:

* **Basic auth** — enabled when ``TRACEBI_AUTH_USER`` and ``TRACEBI_AUTH_PASS``
  are both set. Single shared user/password, suitable for small-team deployments.

* **Proxy header trust** — enabled when ``TRACEBI_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER`` is set.
  Designed for sitting behind Authelia / oauth2-proxy / Cloudflare Access,
  which authenticate the user upstream and forward the identity in a header
  (default ``X-Forwarded-User``). The header value is exposed at
  ``request.state.user`` for downstream handlers. Optionally set
  ``TRACEBI_AUTH_PROXY_TRUSTED_IPS`` (comma-separated) to require the
  request to originate from a known proxy address. The proxy **must replace
  any client-supplied role header** (``TRACEBI_AUTH_ROLE_HEADER``), which is
  trusted in this mode precisely because the proxy sets it. Appending is
  tolerated — the last occurrence is the one read — but a proxy that neither
  strips nor sets it hands the role back to the caller.

Both modes exempt ``/api/health`` so liveness probes work without credentials.
For multi-user identity, use the proxy mode.
