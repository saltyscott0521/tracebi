"""Same-origin CSRF guard for state-changing requests.

Basic-auth credentials are auto-attached by the browser, so a page on another
site could drive a cross-site POST to a state-changing endpoint — the code-exec
``requests`` run, or a warehouse-writing pipeline run — with the user's
credentials riding along. CORS does not stop this: a "simple" cross-site POST
is still *delivered* to the server; CORS only blocks the attacker from reading
the response.

The guard is deliberately simple. A browser always sends an ``Origin`` header
on a state-changing cross-site request, so:

* an unsafe request whose ``Origin`` is present and not allowed is refused;
* an unsafe request with **no** ``Origin`` (curl, the CLI, server-to-server) is
  not a browser CSRF, so it is allowed — this keeps non-browser clients working.

Allowed origins are the app's own (same host:port as the request) plus the
configured frontend origins, extendable with ``TRACEBI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS``.
