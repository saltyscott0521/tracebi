Report — declarative, code-defined report structure.

A Report is built from Sections. Each section holds a DataSet (with its
full lineage) and rendering hints. The same Report object can be rendered
to Excel, HTML, or PDF without changing the definition.

Every rendered report carries a ReportManifest: a complete record of
what data was used, what code produced it, and when it was run.
