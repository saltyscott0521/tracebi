"""Parquet embed transport for the artifact data layer.

The artifact embeds a figure's data as **Parquet** — compact (≈8–17× smaller
than the same CSV), and the format the client-side worker engine decodes in the
browser. See ``docs/large-detail-artifacts.md``.

The receipt for a Parquet block hashes the SHIPPED BYTES. The manifest records
``payload_sha256`` — SHA-256 over the exact base64-decoded Parquet payload the
page carries — and ``verify --file`` recomputes that same hash from the file, so
the check is byte-exact, host-independent, and needs no Parquet reader at all.
Nothing is ever re-derived on the verifier's machine: three adversarial reviews
showed that ANY re-derivation drifts (writer dtype mapping, ``os.linesep``,
library versions) and turns an untouched artifact into a false FILE ALTERED —
so the design hashes what ships, which removes the failure mode instead of
narrowing it. The binding's ``embedded_sha256`` (the source frame's content
fingerprint) is still recorded beside it, tying the record to its section, and
existing CSV-embed receipts are untouched.

**Why pyarrow and not DuckDB (for the writer).** pyarrow is Parquet's reference
implementation and preserves pandas frames far more faithfully — DuckDB maps
frames through *its* SQL type system, and notably rendered timezone-aware
timestamps in the READER'S local zone. The receipt no longer depends on any of
this (bytes are hashed as shipped), but faithful encoding still matters for
what the browser engine DISPLAYS, and ``_renders_identically`` in ``embed.py``
is the gate that keeps display-divergent types on the CSV transport.
