"""
Presentation defaults derived from what the model already knows.

Without this, a table rendered straight from a star-schema query shows a
heading of ``DIM_BRANCH.REGION`` and a figure of ``1705495.2200000002``. Both
are fixable — ``column_labels`` and ``number_formats`` have always existed —
but only by an author remembering to reach for them on every table. A human
authoring one report and looking at the result will notice. Something
composing reports at volume, with nobody reading the output, will not.

So the defaults should not be raw; they should be derived. The information
needed is already present:

* a query result carries its model, its measures and its query spec in the
  last lineage node, so the renderer can tell a measure from a dimension
  attribute rather than guessing from dtype alone
* a named measure declared with ``format="currency"`` states its own
  presentation, and that declaration is the shared definition every report
  already agrees on

Anything explicit always wins. These are defaults, not policy — an author who
sets a label or a format gets exactly what they asked for.
