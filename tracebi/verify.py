"""
Verify a rendered report manifest against the project's models.

This closes the loop the manifest opens. Render time stamps every
data-bearing section with the resolved query spec, the full lineage chain
(including a fingerprint of every source table loaded), and a fingerprint
of the result. Verify time re-runs each recorded query against today's
models and data and classifies the outcome:

* **reproduces** — the re-run's fingerprint matches the manifest.
* **model_changed** — a table now loads from a different source/connector
  than the manifest records: a governance event, alarming (exit 1)
* **source_drift** — the result differs AND at least one recorded input
  fingerprint no longer matches the source table: the data moved.
* **unexplained** — the result differs but every input fingerprint still
  matches. The inputs did not move, so something else did — model code,
  measure definitions, engine behaviour. This is the alarming case.
* **mismatch_unknown_cause** — the result differs and the manifest recorded
  no input fingerprints (rendered before they existed), so drift cannot be
  told apart from unexplained. Reported honestly rather than guessed.
* **unverifiable** — the section carries no recorded query (python-authored
  ad hoc data), or was transformed after the query, so the query alone
  cannot reproduce it.
* **error** — the recorded query could not be re-run at all (model missing,
  query raises). Loud, never silently skipped.

The whole receipt then gets one **verdict** (:data:`VERDICT_EXIT_CODES`),
which is what the exit code and the ``ok`` boolean are both derived from.
``reproduces`` is the only verdict that means a number was re-run and
matched: a manifest with no data-bearing section (``nothing_to_verify``),
one whose every section is unverifiable (``unverifiable``), and one this
checker refused to read at all (``refused_newer_schema``) each say so in
their own words rather than borrowing the passing one's — and each says
*which* of the three it is, because "there was nothing to check" and "I
could not check it" are different facts about the receipt.

Consumed by ``tracebi verify <manifest.json>`` and by the gateway's
``verify_manifest`` MCP tool; both are thin presentation layers over
:func:`verify_manifest` here.
