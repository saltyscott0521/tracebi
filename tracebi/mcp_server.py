"""
The agent gateway: TraceBi's kernel exposed over the Model Context Protocol.

An agent connected here never touches the warehouse. It sees the semantic
contract (``describe()`` plus each model's tables, dimensions and named
measures), asks star-schema questions in that vocabulary, and gets back
**stamped** results: the rows, plus the resolved query, the full lineage
chain, and a fingerprint of the complete result. The stamp is the point —
any number an agent puts in front of a person is traceable back to exactly
which query produced it, whether or not the agent used TraceBi to render
the page it appears on.

Deliberately read-and-compute only. Queries, validation and spec rendering
compute but persist nothing beyond an output file; pipeline execution
writes to the warehouse and stays off this surface until per-agent scopes
exist to gate it. The draft tools are the one other write: they write under
``drafts/``, and ``publish_draft`` copies a validated draft into the library
(report packages and declarative models only, never Python).

Two layers, on purpose:

* module-level ``gateway_*`` functions — plain Python, fully testable with
  no MCP dependency installed
* :func:`build_server` — a thin registration of those functions as MCP
  tools, the only place the optional ``mcp`` package is imported

Run it with ``tracebi mcp`` (stdio, for a local agent) or
``tracebi mcp --transport http --port 8765`` (for a remote one).

# Working with the TraceBi gateway

TraceBi is a trust layer for AI-generated analytics: every number you put in
front of a person should carry a receipt. This gateway is how you produce one.

## The loop
1. **get_context** — first call. Returns the whole vocabulary: models, facts,
   dimensions, named measures, the `presentation` block (the `data-tb-*`
   figure grammar, tokens, formats) and `transform_contracts`. Nothing
   outside it validates. A lesson body is the resource
   `tracebi://knowledge/{slug}` (the index is `analyst_knowledge.lessons`).
2. **query_model** — ask star-schema questions. Every result is *stamped*: the
   resolved query, the lineage chain, and a SHA-256 fingerprint of the full
   result. Cite the fingerprint with any number you quote. The response's
   `binding` object is the value of `data.<name>` in report.json — paste
   it there under a name you choose. "Top N" is
   `order_by` + `limit` in the query — declarative, in the receipt.
3. **author the report** — the report form is an ARTIFACT PACKAGE
   (`reports/<name>/`): `report.json` names query bindings; `template.html`
   is your page, where every figure claims a binding via
   `data-tb-figure` + `data-tb-binding` (or is honestly
   `data-tb-unverified` — no third state). Any element works, including a
   `<span>` inside a sentence: bind prose numbers instead of typing them.
   Blocks marked `data-tb-stage="exploration"` die at build. Interactive
   objects are declarative too: `data-tb-filter` / `data-tb-search` subset
   which stamped rows display (never compute — value figures are exempt),
   tables scroll past `data-tb-rows`, `data-tb-download` exports the
   stamped CSV verbatim, tabs via `data-tb-tab`, layouts via
   `.tb-cols-2/3`; every built page carries the receipt drawer. Details
   in get_context's `presentation` block.
   (A JSON ReportSpec is the same thing as a serialization — read
   `tracebi://spec-schema`, then **validate_report_spec** →
   **render_report_spec**, which refuses invalid specs. Heed validate's
   warnings, not just its errors: a filter/column it cannot pre-verify fails
   at render if it is wrong — render returns a clean `{ok:false}` to act on.)
4. **workbench_state** — while iterating under `tracebi dev`, read this
   before every editing pass: the human steers by leaving notes (and pins)
   in the app, and they come first. Its `pointing` is what the
   human is pointing at right now: when they say "this" or "here", that is
   the figure (`id`, `binding`, `cell`) or the element (`selector`, `text`,
   `section`) they mean. After you act on a pin, call
   **resolve_pin** with a one-line note. It moves that pin into the
   resolved list in pins.json and writes nothing else.
5. **build_report** — the publish step: builds the package to a
   self-contained HTML + manifest, validating every figure claim. Writes
   only its own artifact and receipt. `format="xlsx"` also writes
   `<name>.xlsx` beside them. The spreadsheet carries no receipt and is
   not verifiable; the HTML and manifest are the checkable artifact.
   `format="pdf"` also writes `<name>.pdf`: a print of that built HTML,
   which carries no receipt.
6. **fetch_artifact** — build/render return a server-side PATH, not bytes.
   The argument is `path`. `build_report` returns `output_path` (the HTML)
   and `manifest_path`; `render_report_spec` returns `html_path` and
   `manifest_path`. Pass one of those as `fetch_artifact(path=...)`. An
   xlsx build also returns `xlsx_path`, and a pdf build returns `pdf_path`
   — pass either as `fetch_artifact(path=...)`. HTML and JSON come back as
   text; an `.xlsx` or `.pdf` comes back base64-encoded with its media type.
7. **verify_manifest** — the argument is `manifest`. Pass `build_report`'s
   `manifest_path` as `verify_manifest(manifest=...)` (or
   `render_report_spec`'s `manifest_path`). It re-runs the recorded queries
   and classifies each section. Only `reproduces` means a number was
   re-run and matched; a manifest with nothing to check is not a pass.

## The two planes
- **Definition plane (git):** transforms, models, report specs are authored
  and code-reviewed in the repo. A REUSABLE measure belongs here — a reviewed
  edit to the model file, not a workaround in the report layer. But a one-off
  derived number never dead-ends the loop: `query_model` measures accept
  `{expr, agg}` and `{ratio: [num, den]}` alongside declared names, so you can
  compute it in the query itself (and promote it to a declared measure later).
- **Contract plane (this gateway):** you *use* the semantic contract; you do
  not change it here. The gateway is read-and-compute only — it never writes
  the warehouse. `render_report_spec` and `build_report` write only their
  own artifact and receipt. `resolve_pin` writes only the workbench's
  pins.json. The read tools are annotated read-only so a client can see it.

## The rules
- Never quote a number without its fingerprint.
- Never hard-code a figure a query could produce.
- Always verify before you claim done: `build_report(report=...)`, then
  pass that result's `manifest_path` as `verify_manifest(manifest=...)`,
  and read the verdict. "Built" is not "verified" — only a `reproduces`
  verdict earns the word.
- If something can't be verified, say so — an honest "unverifiable" beats a
  green badge on unchecked work.
- The trust machinery covers the model boundary onward (the query and the
  report), not the phase-① pandas that built the warehouse. A transform may
  declare a *sink contract* (checks on the tables it lands, recorded beside
  the warehouse); a report manifest's `transform_contracts` block then says
  whether each loaded table's sink satisfied its contract — `satisfied`,
  `stale` (re-sunk since checked; never green), or `no_contract`. That claim
  certifies the sink, never the pandas, and never colors a figure status.

## A worked example
Say get_context showed a fact `fact_orders` with a `revenue` measure and a
`dim_customer.region` dimension. The loop, concretely:

1. Explore — one query, stamped:
   `query_model(model="sales", fact="fact_orders", measures={"revenue":"sum"},
   dimensions=["dim_customer.region"])` → rows + a fingerprint. Need a derived
   number the model hasn't declared? Compute it inline, no model edit:
   `measures={"margin": {"expr": "revenue - cost", "agg": "sum"}}`.

2. Bind — `report.json` is one object. A complete minimal file:

   ```json
   __REPORT_JSON_EXAMPLE__
   ```

   __REPORT_JSON_LIBS_NOTE__ Paste each `query_model` result's `binding`
   object as the value of `data.<name>`.

3. Draw — template.html. Every number claims a binding; the runtime fills the
   `—` placeholder from the stamped bytes, so a hard-coded number is impossible:
   `<span data-tb-figure="value" data-tb-binding="kpis" data-tb-cell="revenue"
   data-tb-format="currency0">—</span>` and
   `<table data-tb-figure="table" data-tb-binding="region"></table>`.
   A value figure needs a one-row binding: its own query with no
   dimensions (the `kpis` binding above), or `order_by` plus `limit` 1.
   The cell may be text, such as the top sector's name.
   A number with no query behind it is honest only as `data-tb-unverified` —
   never a value figure with the number typed in.

4. Publish and check — `build_report(report="sales_by_region")` returns
   `output_path` and `manifest_path`. Pass `manifest_path` as
   `verify_manifest(manifest=...)`. To read the page, pass `output_path`
   as `fetch_artifact(path=...)`. Report the verdict; only `reproduces`
   means re-run and matched.
