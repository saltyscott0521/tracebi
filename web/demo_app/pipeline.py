"""
Medallion pipeline for the demo app.

Defines Landing → Manipulation → Final and exports ``runner`` and
``pipeline_model`` (the latter for the medallion_revenue report).

**Definition and execution are separate here, and which one you get depends on
where the data lives.** See NOTES.md, "Deployment planes".

* With ``TRACEBI_DEMO_DB_URL`` set — a real Postgres, e.g. Supabase — importing
  this module only *defines* layers. Nothing is seeded and nothing is run. The
  data is already there because something else put it there: the execution
  plane, via ``tracebi run-pipeline`` from a cron job, a CI step, or a laptop.
  Importing the module in a web process does no work at all.

* Without it, the pipeline falls back to an ephemeral SQLite file and seeds
  and runs itself at import, because otherwise there is nowhere for an
  execution plane to have written and the demo would come up empty. That is
  the compromise a serverless deployment with no database forces, and it is
  exactly the thing pointing at Postgres removes.

``seed_and_run()`` is the execution-plane entry point for both cases.
