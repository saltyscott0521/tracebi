# # Phase ① — TRANSFORM: what it took to buy and carry a median home
#
# Reads the annual series in `inputs/housing_history.csv` and asks the two
# questions affordability actually is:
#
# 1. **Can you get in?** The cash to close — the down payment plus closing
#    costs — measured in months of median household income.
# 2. **Can you carry it?** The full monthly payment — principal, interest,
#    property tax and insurance — as a share of income, per household and per
#    single full-time earner. And not only in the first year: each year's
#    buyer is followed for up to ten years, refinancing when rates fall, with
#    income rising and taxes growing with the home's value.
#
# Then it SINKS a small star schema into the warehouse.
#
# Assumptions, stated once and carried into the report's methodology:
# an existing home at the median price, 20% down (so no mortgage insurance),
# closing costs of 3% of price, a 30-year fixed loan at that year's average
# rate, property tax 1.1% and insurance 0.35% of the home's value a year —
# the same in every year, so no era is flattered by a different assumption.
# A buyer refinances the remaining balance, over the remaining term, in any
# later year whose average rate is at least a full point below the rate they
# hold; refinancing costs are left out. A buyer's ten-year share adds the cash
# to close to the first ten years of payments, over the first ten years of
# median household income.
#
#     python transforms/affordability_transform.py
#
# Idempotent: rerun any time; it replaces the warehouse tables.
